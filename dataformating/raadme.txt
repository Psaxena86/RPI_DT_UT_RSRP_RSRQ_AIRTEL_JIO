1) should have all libraries required are installed
2) should have dsusfile generated from the speed test experiments 
3) you should and all signal pdfs generated while speed test into the airtel_pdf or jio_pdf folders
4) for jio goto jio folder and run python3 compose3.py
5) for airtel goto airtel folder and run python3 compose4.py
6) you will get final_artel_csv.csv or final_jio_csv.csv file
which is final outcome of data format
7) for final csv formate refer attached airtel_sample_csv_format or jio_sample_csv.csv

Thank you
